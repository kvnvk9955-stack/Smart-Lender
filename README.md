# 🏦 Smart Lender — AI-Powered Loan Eligibility Predictor


Smart Lender is an AI-powered web application that predicts loan approval eligibility using Machine Learning. The application analyzes applicant information such as income, credit history, education, employment status, and loan details to provide instant loan approval predictions along with confidence scores.

Designed with a modern user interface and powered by an optimized XGBoost model, Smart Lender demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a Machine Learning project—from data preprocessing and model training to deployment as a production-ready Flask web application.

## 📖 Project Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications every day. Manual verification is often time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.

Smart Lender simplifies this process by leveraging Machine Learning to predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved. The application processes applicant information, performs necessary preprocessing, feeds the data into a trained XGBoost classifier, and instantly returns the prediction with a confidence score.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, including:

* Data Collection
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Training
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Model Evaluation
* Web Deployment
* Prediction Logging
